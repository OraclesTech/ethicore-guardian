This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with modifications specific to security-focused open source projects.

## Special Considerations for AI Security

Given Guardian's focus on AI security, we have additional expectations:

### Responsible Disclosure

* Report vulnerabilities privately first (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
* Don't exploit vulnerabilities to harm users
* Don't share attack techniques irresponsibly

### Research Ethics

* Respect AI platform terms of service when testing
* Don't use Guardian research to develop harmful attacks
* Consider dual-use risks when sharing techniques

### User Privacy

* Never share real user data (prompts, logs, etc.) without permission
* Anonymize examples when discussing issues
* Respect that Guardian's mission is protecting privacy
