- **Include:**
  - Guardian version
  - Browser & OS
  - Steps to reproduce

  - Screenshots/logs if applicable

**Template:**
```markdown
**Bug Description:**
[Clear description]

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to...
2. Click on...
3. See error

**Expected Behavior:**
[What should happen]

- Browser: Firefox 120
- OS: Windows 11

**Screenshots/Logs:**
[Attach if relevant]
```

### 2. üéØ Add Threat Patterns

Know a jailbreak technique Guardian misses? Share it!

**Process:**
1. Fork the repository
2. Edit `core/threat-patterns.js`
3. Add your pattern to the appropriate category
4. Test it thoroughly
5. Submit PR with examples

**Pattern Template:**
```javascript
newThreatCategory: {
    patterns: [
        /your\s+regex\s+pattern/gi,
        // Add multiple variants
    ],
    severity: 'CRITICAL' | 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW',
    weight: 100,  // 0-100 scoring
    description: 'Brief explanation of threat',
    semanticFingerprint: [
        'semantic variant 1',
        'semantic variant 2',
        // Natural language versions
    ],
    contextHints: {
        escalators: ['urgent', 'must'],  // Increase suspicion
        mitigators: ['example', 'demo']   // Decrease suspicion
    },
    falsePositiveRisk: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH',
    mitigationStrategy: 'How to reduce false positives'
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Include 3-5 regex patterns per category
- Add 5-10 semantic fingerprints
- Test against real jailbreaks
- Consider false positive risk
- Document in comments

### 3. üß™ Submit Test Cases

Real-world examples make Guardian stronger.

**What to share:**
- Actual jailbreak attempts (anonymized)
- Edge cases Guardian misses
- False positive examples
- Novel attack techniques

**Format:**
```javascript
// tests/jailbreaks/test-cases.js
{
    id: "JAILBREAK_001",
    category: "instructionOverride",
    severity: "CRITICAL",
    text: "The actual prompt text here...",
    expectedDetection: true,
    actualDetection: false,  // If Guardian missed it
    notes: "Uses obfuscation technique X"
}
```

### 4. üìù Improve Documentation

Documentation is crucial for adoption.

**Areas needing help:**
- Clarifying technical explanations
- Adding examples and diagrams
- Fixing typos and grammar
- Translating to other languages (future)
- Video tutorials (future)

**Process:**
1. Find what needs improvement
2. Make changes in markdown files
3. Submit PR with clear description

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Use clear, descriptive names
function detectJailbreakPattern(text, patterns) {
    // Use camelCase for variables
    const threatScore = 0;
    
    // Comments for complex logic
    // This loop checks each pattern against the input
    for (const pattern of patterns) {
        // ...
    }
    
    // Return objects with clear structure
    return {
        detected: true,
        score: threatScore,
        category: 'instructionOverride'
    };
}

// Use 4-space indentation
// Add blank lines between logical sections
```

**Comments:**
```javascript
// Good: Explain WHY, not WHAT
// We use time-decay to prioritize recent threats
const decay = Math.pow(0.85, ageMinutes / 10);

// Bad: Obvious comment
// Loop through patterns
for (const pattern of patterns) { ... }
```

### Commit Messages

**Format:**
```
Type: Brief description (50 chars max)

Longer explanation if needed (wrap at 72 chars).
